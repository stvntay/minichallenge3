// This optional file is used to store the standard alphabet and numeral set for a language
//	The file must be in UTF-8
//	Empty lines are skipped
//	All lines starting with "//" are skipped
//  Otherwise, what you put here is what the user will see, perhaps with line breaks removed
//
// It's main use is to let a language have a custom display string when the default display
//	string for the script is inappropriate: e.g., if the script is Latin and you don't want
//	the English alphabet used as your display string
// This string is used in the "sample" view.
//
// Localizers: This should be something similar to what the sample view has displayed
//	in the past, but specific to *your* language.  If you don't need anything
//	special, omit this file altogether.
